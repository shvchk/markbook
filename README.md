# Introduction

Markbook is a proof of concept project that lets you make a book from markdown files, rendering them in the browser on the fly. It is inspired by [GitBook](http://help.gitbook.io) and looks a lot like it (well, not yet :)), but there is no need to compile book into HTML â€” your markdown pages remain untouched and any edit is available instantly.
